## Hi there 👋, my name is Adi Pawar

I’m a junior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Economics at the Georgia State University Honors College.

I’m highly motivated and focused on **AI, Machine Learning, Generative AI, Full-Stack Web Development, and Data Science**. I have hands-on experience with **Python, JavaScript, React.js, SQL**, and cloud technologies, and I enjoy building projects that combine strong technical foundations with real-world impact.

Beyond tech, I’m interested in **entrepreneurship and business strategy**, particularly how technology can drive scalable solutions. In my free time, I enjoy playing outdoor sports like badminton, soccer, and basketball, going to the gym, and hiking.
